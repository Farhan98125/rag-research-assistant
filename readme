🎯 What Is the Purpose of This Project?
🔹 Core Purpose

This project demonstrates how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can answer questions from a research paper.

In simple terms:

👉 Instead of the model guessing answers, it retrieves relevant parts of the document first, then generates a grounded answer.

🧠 Why Is This Important?

Large language models (LLMs):

Can hallucinate

Don’t remember specific PDFs

Don’t have access to your private documents

So we build RAG systems to:

✔ Connect LLMs with external documents
✔ Make answers grounded in real text
✔ Reduce hallucination
✔ Enable document-based QA

🏗 What Your Project Specifically Does

Your system:

Loads a research paper (PDF)

Cleans the text

Splits it into meaningful chunks

Converts chunks into semantic embeddings

Stores them in a FAISS vector database

When user asks a question:

It converts the query into an embedding

Finds the most relevant chunks

Sends that context to the LLM

The LLM generates an answer based on retrieved context

📌 Academic Purpose

This project shows you understand:

Text preprocessing

Semantic embeddings

Vector similarity search

FAISS indexing

Prompt engineering

Context-aware generation

Modular AI system design

This is not just coding — it’s AI system design.
